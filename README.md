## Purpose
Slack has a great web API which is documented [here](https://api.slack.com/web). In addition there are a couple of so called "undocumented" methods. These methods provide some additional and very useful functionality that is not available with the official set of API methods. The purpose of this document is to provide an up-to-date documentation to anyone who wants to use these methods.

> **IMPORTANT UPDATE**: Slack has decided to remove legacy tokens from their API. It will no longer be possible to create new legacy tokens as of May 5th, 2020 ([Source](https://api.slack.com/changelog/2020-02-legacy-test-token-creation-to-retire)). If you have a working legacy token you should be able to continue using the undocumented API methods, but new users will not. Please take this into consideration when deciding about using any of the methods from this repo in your apps.

## Disclaimer
Please note that Slack explicitely states in its [API Terms of Service](https://slack.com/terms-of-service/api) that all undocumented methods "may change at any time, you should not rely on these behaviors.". So use them at your own risk.

## Scope of this repo
This repo contains a documentation of so called "undocumented" API methods for Slack. These methods are not documented in the official API documentation and usually require a [legacy token](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens) to be used.

API methods that are only available via the web UI and require a runtime token are **out of scope** of this repo.

## How to use undocumented API methods
- **Token type**: In general all undocumented API methods require the `post` scopes and therefore needs to be called with a [legacy token](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens).
- **Slack apps**: Since the `post` scope is not available through the standard Oauth process they can not be directly used in a normal Slack app. In order to use them in a Slack app a legacy token for the respective workspace needs to always be manually create and added.
- **Request types**: In general these API methods support GET and standard POST requests only. Standard POST requests use bodies encoded as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. The more modern JSON encoded bodies are not supported.
